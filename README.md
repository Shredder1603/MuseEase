## Project Description: 
 >MuseEase aims to streamline music creation by offering a desktop-based platform (Windows) that simplifies the music making process for beginners and non-musicians. Traditional applications like GarageBand, Logic Pro, and FL Studio require extensive prior knowledge and skills which poses as a significant barrier to entry to new creators, with some applications charging fees to access their tools. MuseEase bridges the gap with intuitive tutorials, and potential AI-powered assistance which allows users to maximize their creativity and create professional-quality music without purchase.
